# Store-Analysis-and-Performance
## Overview 
The problem statement was to analyse a set of stores for Quantium , compare their performance , their customer preferences,segmenation of customer those are frequent to which store and store performance over the year to produce a result keeping in mind to find a control store that did not vary much over time period and performance still remains high afterwhich a result containing the insights analysed. The Data exploration using the seaborn library and Matplotlib had been provided as an visual evidence of data exploration.Some of which are given below for a quick understanding.

## Results:
The store 77 and 146 are to be analysed for control stores
